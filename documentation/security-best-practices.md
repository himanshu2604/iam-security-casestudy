# IAM Security Best Practices

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum permissions required for job function
- Regularly audit and remove unused permissions
- Use condition-based policies for additional restrictions

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Mandatory for all users** accessing sensitive resources
- Use virtual MFA devices (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Enforce MFA for console access and API calls

### 3. Strong Password Policies
- Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements
- Regular password rotation (90 days)
- Prevent password reuse (last 12 passwords)
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## Access Control Strategies

### Group-Based Permissions
- **Never attach policies directly to users**
- Create functional groups (EC2-Operators, RDS-Admins)
- Use AWS managed policies when appropriate
- Create custom policies for specific business needs

### Conditional Access Controls
```json
{
  "Condition": {
    "IpAddress": {
      "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
    },
    "Bool": {
      "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

### Time-Based Access
- Implement time restrictions for sensitive operations
- Use temporary credentials for automated processes
- Set session duration limits

## Monitoring & Auditing

### CloudTrail Configuration
- Enable in all regions
- Configure log file validation
- Set up real-time monitoring with CloudWatch
- Store logs in secure S3 bucket

### Access Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review user permissions and group memberships
- **Quarterly**: Full access audit and cleanup
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security assessment

### Key Monitoring Metrics
- Failed login attempts
- Permission escalation events
- Unusual API call patterns
- Cross-region resource access

## Resource Protection

### Tagging Strategy
```json
{
  "Environment": "Production|Development|Staging",
  "Project": "XYZ-Migration",
  "Owner": "team-email@company.com",
  "CostCenter": "IT-Infrastructure"
}
```

### Resource-Level Permissions
- Use ARN-based restrictions
- Implement resource-specific conditions
- Separate development and production access

## Incident Response

### Security Event Response
1. **Immediate**: Disable compromised accounts
2. **Investigation**: Review CloudTrail logs
3. **Containment**: Limit damage scope
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure access
5. **Learning**: Update policies and procedures

### Common Security Threats
- **Credential theft**: Implement MFA and rotation
- **Privilege escalation**: Regular permission audits
- **Data exfiltration**: Monitor unusual data access patterns
- **Account takeover**: Strong authentication and monitoring

## Automation Recommendations

### Security Automation
- Automated user provisioning/deprovisioning
- Regular access reviews with automated reporting
- Policy compliance monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns

### Integration Points
- Identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Configuration management tools
- Compliance reporting systems

## Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Requirements
- **SOX**: Financial data access controls
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information protection
- **GDPR**: Personal data processing controls
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

### Documentation Requirements
- Access control procedures
- Security incident logs
- Regular audit reports
- Policy review documentation
